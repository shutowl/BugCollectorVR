- [ ] Add death animations to bugs

- [ ] add death sounds to bugs

- [ ] Add Table and chair to scene

- [ ] Change Menu Fonts

- [ ] Make title screen

- [ ] add sounds to bugs

- [ ] switch from SteamVR scripts to OpenXR

- [ ] new spawning system
  - [ ] bugs spawn in area around player, not just in specific points
    - [ ] just check for ground intersection and air above the bug
    - [ ]  bugs can spawn under rocks
    - [ ]  bugs can spawn in logs
  - [ ] probably have to change hit detection to be over a certain threshold of physics
  
- [ ] Scale bugs approximately, this should be a very slight speedup since the engine doesn't have to translate the vertices (re export?)
